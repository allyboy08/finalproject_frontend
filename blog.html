        <h4>Goalie</h4>
        <p>
          The goalkeeper (or goalie) in field hockey is 
          one of the most important positions in the sport,
          as the player has weighty responsibilities.
          They stand alone in front of their team’s goal, 
          with their sole mission being to protect it from the opposing team. 
          With just one mistake or save, a goalie can make the difference between a win or a loss.
          A goalie, therefore, requires more than just physical training. 
          They have to be mentally prepared as well.
        </p>

        <h4>Defender</h4>
        <p>
          Fullbacks are primarily defensive players. 
          Their primary role is to defend an opposing forward and 
          keep the ball away from reaching the goalie. 
          A successful defensive stop will result in getting the 
          ball back to the other side so the mid-fielders and forwards can score. 
          A fullback should know where their opponent is constantly and support the 
          mid-fielder when switching into the attack. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="cards">
        <h4>mid</h4>
        <p>
          Midfielders, also known as halfbacks, 
          must be able to play both defense and offense as they are 
          considered to be multi-taskers on the turf. 
          It is important that midfielders have a high stamina because of their 
          constant movement up and down the field. Midfielders must be ready to defend 
          quickly if an offensive attack fails, while remaining vigilant to where the ball is. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="cards2">
        <h4>attack</h4>
        <p>
         You can find forwards in between midfield and the opponent’s goalie. 
         They are typically the people who score the most goals in a game. 
         Forwards are also known to be called strikers. Their main job on the turf 
         is to work together to head downfield and score. Great forwards are unselfish, 
         move quickly, and create spacing and ball movement to help their teammates.

          When searching for the perfect stick, defenders will often choose
          heavier sticks with the weight concentrated in the head of the stick.
          This allows them to make stronger block tackles, and the extra weight
          will help generate more momentum when hitting the ball down the field.
          Also, often times, defenders will buy slightly longer sticks than
          their player height recommends to give them a little extra reach when
          tackling and jabbing at the ball.
