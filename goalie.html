      <h2>Reflex Training</h2>
      <p>Equipment Needed: 2 Golf balls, 1 brick/concrete wall</p>
      <p>Description:</p>
      <p>
        Start with one golf ball, throwing it against the wall and catching it
      </p>
      <p>
        You can either throw it straight at the wall (no bounce), bounce it onto
        the ground the off the wall, or bounce it so it hits the wall then the
        ground before you catch it
      </p>
      <p>Alternate hands</p>
      <p>
        As you get better, move in closer so that you have less time to react
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you feel confident enough, have one golf ball in each hand, and
        throw them one after the other so that as you catch one in your left
        hand you throw the one in your right hand and vice versa
      </p>
      <h2>star drill</h2>
      <p>Equipment Needed: 5 cones </p>
      <p>Goalkeeper starts at bottom cone •    Sprint to middle •    Side step to left cone, then back to middle  •    Sprint to top cone, then run backwards to middle •    Side step to right cone, then back to middle •    Backwards to bottom cone to finish   Points to remember: •    Keep head and eyes up •    Use small shuffle steps as you would in a game •    Don’t look backwards, use peripheral vision to tell where cones are </p>
      <h2>audible reaction</h2>
      <p>Equipment Needed: 6 cones </p>
      <p>The goalkeeper starts at cone number 1, then side steps to cone 2 then to cone 3 then back to middle •    This continues until the coach shouts either A, B or C •    On hearing the cue the goalkeeper must immediately sprint to the cone called e.g. A and then jog backwards to cone 1 again •    Do this 3 times and then take a break •    The coach can shout the letter whenever they want but don’t make the goalkeeper wait too long for the cue </p>
